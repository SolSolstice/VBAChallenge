This assignment was hard lol. 


It was a rollercoaster of emotions, and really pushed the boundaries of what I thought I was capable 


I utilized some sources on google (listed in the excel) & study groups with my peers. This assignment was a genuine bonding experience with the people in this bootcamp and I'm excited for the next!
